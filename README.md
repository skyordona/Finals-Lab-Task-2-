# [Finals Lab Task 2 - Transforming ER Model to Relational Tables](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19631554/Soguilon.Carl.Asnef.B.FINALS2.EDM.SQL.docx)
- This portfolio demonstrates my understanding of MySQL database creation using a simplified student assignment submission system. It covers the step-by-step creation of tables representing students, assignments, and their submissions. This exercise applies data types, relationships, and constraints like primary keys, foreign keys, and composite keys to build a fully functional relational schema.

# Step By Step Process
### 1. Create the student table:
- Define username as a VARCHAR(50).
- Set username as the Primary Key.

### 2. Create the assignment table:
- Define shortname as a VARCHAR(50) and set it as the Primary Key.
- Define due_date as a DATE NOT NULL.
- Define url as a VARCHAR(255), which can be null.

### 3. Create the submission table:
- Define username and shortname both as VARCHAR(50).
- Define version as an INT.
- Define submit_date as a DATE NOT NULL.
- Define data as TEXT.
- Set a composite primary key of (username, shortname, version).
- Add foreign keys referencing the student and assignment tables.
